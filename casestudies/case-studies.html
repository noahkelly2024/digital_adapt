                <h3>Google Stadia Shutdown</h3>
                <p>Google Stadia, a cloud gaming service, was launched in 2019 with high hopes but was shut down abruptly in early 2023. Users who had purchased games or hardware for the platform were left with nothing, as there were no physical copies of the games, and the servers were turned off. While Google did offer refunds, this was an exceptional case, and most companies rarely offer compensation when such investments are lost.</p>

                <h3>BioWare's Anthem</h3>
                <p>BioWareâ€™s online multiplayer game, Anthem, was hyped as a major release in 2019. However, despite promises of continued support and updates, the game was abandoned by its developers in 2020. Players who had invested significant amounts of money and time into the game were left with an incomplete experience, highlighting the dangers of reliance on company-controlled servers and ongoing support.</p>

                <h3>World of Warcraft Server Dependency</h3>
                <p>World of Warcraft (WoW), one of the most iconic multiplayer online games, has long relied on its developer-run servers. When Blizzard Entertainment decides to discontinue a server or stop supporting certain content, players lose access to those parts of the game, despite spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on subscriptions and in-game purchases.</p>

                <h3>Nintendo 3DS & Wii U eShop Shutdown</h3>
                <p>In 2023, Nintendo announced the closure of its 3DS and Wii U eShop stores. Players who had invested large sums of money into digital games were suddenly faced with the reality that they could no longer access their purchases once the eShop was shut down. This case serves as a cautionary tale of how digital ownership can be ephemeral and entirely subject to the whims of corporations.</p>
