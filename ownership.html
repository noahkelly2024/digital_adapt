        <h2>The Problem with Digital Ownership</h2>
        <p>In the digital age, the concept of "ownership" has become increasingly complex and often misleading. Unlike physical goods, digital products—such as software, video games, and e-books—are typically governed by licenses rather than outright ownership. This leaves consumers at the mercy of companies who can revoke access at any time.</p>

        <h2>Common Issues with Digital Ownership</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>License Revocation:</strong> Companies can revoke your access to purchased content without warning, often with no compensation.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Terms of use (EULA) are often lengthy, confusing, and designed to shield companies from liability.</li>
            <li><strong>Short Product Lifespans:</strong> Many digital platforms have short lifespans, leading to abrupt shutdowns that render purchased content inaccessible.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Dependency:</strong> Popular services like Adobe Creative Cloud and Microsoft Office 365 rely on subscription models, where failure to pay results in losing access to tools and files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-World Consequences</h2>
        <p>Digital ownership issues have far-reaching implications for consumers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Financial Loss:</strong> Consumers often spend significant amounts of money on digital goods, only to lose access when servers shut down or licenses are revoked.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Impact:</strong> Many digital goods, especially games, hold sentimental value. Losing access can feel deeply personal.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Risks:</strong> Small businesses and freelancers dependent on subscription-based software face risks if they cannot keep up with payments or if the platform changes terms unexpectedly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>As the world becomes increasingly reliant on digital platforms, the concept of ownership must evolve. Consumers deserve clarity, fairness, and protections against arbitrary revocation of access to the products they invest in.</p>
        <p>By shedding light on these issues, we can push for better regulations, more transparent agreements, and a fairer digital marketplace.</p>
